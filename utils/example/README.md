# BINANA Python Demo

## Command line

To run the BINANA command-line example, type the following into the Unix command
line, from the current directory:

```
python3 ../run_binana.py -receptor ./receptor.pdbqt -ligand ./ligand.pdbqt -output_dir ./cli_example_output/ > output.txt
```

A similar command should work from the Windows command line.

See `../COMMAND_LINE_USE.md` for more details.
